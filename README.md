MediaMarketplace is a full-stack movie-rental platform where users can browse movies, rent or buy them, leave ratings, and watch short previews.  
This repository contains the **frontend UI** built with **React**.

## Overview

The frontend provides a modern, interactive interface for browsing movies, renting or buying them, leaving ratings, and watching previews.  
It communicates with the **Spring Boot backend API**.

## Features

- User registration & login  
- Browse and filter movies  
- Rent or buy movies  
- Rate movies  
- Watch movie previews  
- Fully functional frontend connecting to the backend

## Tech Stack

- **React**  
- **React Hooks & Functional Components**  
- **Axios** for API calls  
- **Material UI** (if used, otherwise remove)  
- Clean component structure

## Running the Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darth4Vader/MediaMarketplaceReact
cd MediaMarketplaceReact
npm install
npm start
 ```

> Make sure the backend is running on http://localhost:8080 for API calls to work.
>
> The frontend runs by default on: http://localhost:3000

# Project Structure
- `components/` – React UI components
- `pages/` – Page-level containers
- `services/` – Axios API calls
- `utils/` – Helpers and constants
- Organized to keep UI modular and maintainable

# What I Focused On

One of the main challenges was building a clean and maintainable component structure to ensure readability and scalability as the app grows.

# Future Improvements
- Improved UX/UI
- Unit and integration tests
